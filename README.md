Dear students,

I recommend you use pip3 to install pygame for Python 3 and psycopg2 for PostgreSQL.
During the presentation I used Postgres.app for MacOS.
For MacOS I recommend using brew to install Python 3 + pip.
For GNU+Linux I recommend using the package repositories of your distribution.
I think Visual Studio comes with pip3; but I can't verify it at the moment.

Good luck!
